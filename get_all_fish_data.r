#
#   Fetch ALL the fish data from Access data base between two dated. 
#   This is a version of F.get.indiv.fish.data, but that routine returns records for a single taxon.
#
#   input:
#   site = site ID of place we want to do estimates for. Note; Site is a location along a river where
#       we can compute passage.  Subsites are places in the river (thalweg, right bank, etc) at the project.
#       Project is a parent of subsite.
#       Site is also a parent of subsite.
#       Project is the funding source of the site.  Site and Project are parallel fields.  In theory,
#       this makes it easier query sites and projects because sometimes the same site is sampled by
#       two different projects.
#   min.date and max.date = minimum and maximum dates for a visit to be included. A string in format "YYYY-MM-DD"
#
