\usage{
F.expand.plus.counts(catch)
}
\arguments{
\item{catch}{A data frame containing missing data for variables 
\code{FinalRun} and/or \code{lifeStage}.}
}
\value{
A data frame with fish whose \code{FinalRun} and/or \code{lifeStage}
  was recorded as unknown reassigned to a run and/or life stage.
}
\description{
Expand a catch data frame to account for plus counts.
}
\details{
Data frame \code{catch} contains records with missing data for one 
  or both of variables \code{FinalRun} and \code{lifeStage}.  These records, 
  via the number recorded in variable \code{Unassigned}, quantify the number 
  of fish whose run and/or life stage is unknown.
  
  Accurate estimation of passage requires the use of all fish in a catch. 
  Sometimes however, catch can number in the thousands.  Practically, these 
  large numbers of fish cannot be individually examined to determine life 
  stage and run.  To quantify the underlying proportions of life stage and 
  run on the catch as a whole, a random selection is drawn.  From this random
  selection, the proportions of individual life stages and runs are 
  quantified via observation.  Plus counts result from applying the 
  proportions of life stage and run obtained via sampling to the unsampled 
  fish.
  
  Sometimes, when examining an individual fish for life stage and run, only 
  one attribute of the two is recorded.  Thus, following sampling and 
  examination, a caught fish falls into one of four separate scenarios: 
  \enumerate{ \item both life stage and run are recorded; \item life stage
  only is missing, but run is recorded; \item run only is missing, but life
  stage is recorded; \item both life stage and run are not recorded. } The
  first three scenarios result from a fish being randomly sampled, while the
  fourth results from a fish not being a part of the sample.
  
  Function \code{F.assign.1dim} assigns missing life stage when run is 
  recorded.  The same function does the same when run is missing but life 
  stage is recorded. Function \code{F.assign.2dim} assigns both missing life 
  stage and run.  Thus, function \code{F.assign.1dim} is the workhorse 
  function for cases 2 and and 3, while \code{F.assign.2dim} is the same for 
  case 4.  Case 1 requires no plus counting, since life stage and run are 
  known.  Function \code{F.expand.plus.counts} calls each of these functions 
  in turn, with each of the one-dimensional calls performed first via
  \code{F.assign.1dim} followed by one call to \code{F.assign.2dim}.
  
  The plus-count algorithm assumes that all unsuccessful or non-fishing 
  visits have been removed from data frame \code{catch} prior to 
  implementation. Variable \code{Unmarked} identifies each of these;  a 
  \code{0} indicates an unsuccessful visit, while missing corresponds to 
  non-fishing.
