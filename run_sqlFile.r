F.run.sqlFile <- function( ch, sqlFile, echo=TRUE, check.drops=FALSE, ... ){
#
#   This function opens the file sqlFile, and runs the sql statements contained therein.
#
#   Inputs:
#       ch = an OPEN RODBC channel
#       sqlFile = name of a text file containing one or more SQL statements. Statements must 
#           be separated by a semicolon ";".  Comments, that are "--" at the start of a line are allowed.
#       echo = if TRUE, the SQL statements are echoed to the R screen. 
#       check.drops = if TRUE, this will check for errors following DROP statements.  The reason for this is that when 
#           sending SQL statements to ACCESS, DROP statements on non-existant tables cause an error. 
#           Many times, we don't want this.  We just need to make sure the table is not there 
#           so we can create it later.  Set this =FALSE and these errors will pass through. 
#           I am not sure about the behavior of DROP when querying other SQL data bases. 
#       ... = named parameters to be substituted into the SQL statement.  This allows R to pass 
#           parameters to SQL for incorporation into things like WHERE clauses. See note.
#
#   Value:
#   The result of the *LAST* SQL statment in the file. Therefore, if you need results back (i.e., you 
#   are not just manipulating tables in the data base), you need to split things up so that the 
#   last SQL statement in the file is the query that returns the results you want.
#
#   Note: any named parameters passed in here will get substituted into the sql statement in 
#   their place.  If, for example, the sql has TAXON in it somewhere, and a parameter to this function is TAXON='16890', 
#   the value '16890' gets substituted into the SQL prior to execution.
#
#
#   

#   --- This is an internal function to check for SQL errors
f.sql.error.check <- function( obj ){
#   Note: this aborts everything when an error occurs. 
#   This could be re-programmed to exit nicely with TRUE or FALSE.
#   Note: This detects an error if obj is 2 in length and has ERROR in the second 
#   position.
