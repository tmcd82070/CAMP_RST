#   tables = vector with named components containing names
#           of the table in db to pull values from
#   site = site ID of place we want to do estimates for. 
#   taxon = the taxon number(s) (from luTaxon) to retrieve.  If a scalar, only 
#       one taxon is retrieved.  If vector of taxon id's, the sum of all 
#       taxons is retrieved.
#   run = the single run ID of the fish we want.  If run = NA, all records for the fish
#       will be pulled. 
#   min.date = minimum date for data to include. This is a text string in the format %Y-%m-%d, or YYYY-MM-DD
#   max.date = maximum date for data to include.  Same format as min.date
#
#   To be included in the catch data, a record has to be from the site, 
#   of the correct taxon, of the correct run, and between min and max dates.
