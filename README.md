CAMP_RST Readme file: 

This repository contains R code associated with the CAMP Rotary Screw Trap platform.  
The RST platform is a data base application that collects and manages rotary screw 
trap data, and was originally built for the network of rotary screw traps in rivers 
of the central valley of California.  These R code files are called from the application
to do analyses.
