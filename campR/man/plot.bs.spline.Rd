\usage{
\method{plot}{bs.spline}(X, fit, beg.x, end.x, eff0 = tmp.df, option, bd2)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{The basis b-spline matrix resulting from a call to function
\code{bs}.}

\item{fit}{The generalized linear model resulting from a call to function
\code{glm}.}

\item{beg.x}{The POSIX-formatted start date to use for plotting.}

\item{end.x}{The POSIX-formatted end date to use for plotting.}
}
\value{
A plot of the fitted cubic spline, its originating data points, and
  the knots utilized to achive the fit.
}
\description{
Plot the results of fitting a temporal b-spline.
}
\details{
Function \code{plot.bs.spline} simply organizes all the pieces 
  necessary to graph the prediction cubic piecewise polynomial resulting from
  the use of a b-spline.  It plots not only the (necessarily) smooth spline,
  but also the original points used to estimate it.  It also plots all knots,
  i.e., both boundary and interior.  It calculates the prediction via matrix 
  multiplication of the provided matrix basis \eqn{X} and the vector of 
  parameter \eqn{\beta} coefficients from object \code{fit}.
  
  This function is customized for use with the CAMP project, and will not 
  work for splines derived from data originating elsewhere without 
  modification.
