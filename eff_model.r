#   Compute and estimate efficiency for all traps and days that are missing in the input data set.
#   i.e., "impute" a value for efficiency when it is missing
#
#   input:
#   obs.eff.df = data frame with at least columns $batchDate, and $efficiency.
#       $efficiency is NA for all days that we need an estimate.  
#   method = scalar specifying type of extrapolation to do.  Method = 1 takes average of entire season. 
#       Method = 2 uses earliest observed efficiency between in intervals between efficiency trials (so called
#       constant model).  Method = 3 is a b-spline model with up to 'max.df.spline' degrees of freedom.
#   max.df.spling = maximum degrees of freedom for splines
#
#   Output:
#   A data frame with all observed $efficiency values, plus a the column $gam.estimated 
#   which is 1 = "Yes" for those that came from the model.
